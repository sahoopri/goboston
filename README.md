### End to End Test Automation  :
This is a simple node.js framework that automates the Leisure Pass Group - Go-Boston All Inclusive Pass webpage using Taiko, which allows targeting of the DOM using text rather than selectors and Gauge which supports writing Behaviour driven development BDD spec files.

#### Features : 
* Clear folder structure
* Runnning tests in parallel 

#### Scenarios Covered :
* E2E purchase of all inclusive pass using Credit/Debit card (the tests in real world will use CC details from .env file but currently hardcoded)
* E2E purchase of all inclusive pass using Paypal (Just confirming here that user is redirected to paypal login modal and then back, due to lack of active paypal account)
